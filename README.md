## UX

### User Stories

Bake Boutique was designed with three types of users in mind: 

- **Public Users**:
  - Browse baked goods and view product details without signing in.
  - Access the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages for more information.

- **Private Users**:
  - Create accounts and sign in to access custom features like the wishlist.
  - Place orders and view order history.

- **Admin/Staff Users**:
  - Manage product inventory and customer orders efficiently.

### Design Thinking

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Bake Boutique is designed to ensure smooth navigation and intuitive usability.
- **Mobile-First Design**: The platform is fully responsive, offering an optimized experience across devices.
- **Warm and Welcoming**: The platform's color scheme and visual elements create an inviting experience for users.

### Colour Scheme

A warm palette inspired by baked goods was selected. Soft tones combined with bold accents create a visually appealing aesthetic that resonates with the theme of a bakery.

- [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) is also used for creating flexible, responsive layouts.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) is used to enhance user interaction and dynamic elements on the site.
- [Python](https://www.python.org) is used as the back-end programming language, handling server-side functionality.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) is used for version control, allowing me to track and manage changes (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`).
- [GitHub](https://github.com) is used for secure online storage of the project code and for collaboration.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) is the cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing and testing code.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is used to create a responsive front-end design with pre-built components and styling.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is the Python framework used to develop the back-end of the site and manage its functionalities.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is used as the relational database to store data such as user information and recipes.
- [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) is used to host the PostgreSQL database for production.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is the hosting platform used to deploy and run the live site.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) is used for managing and hosting static files and images for the site.

### Main Languages Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend development.
- Python (Django) for backend logic.
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for database management.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
- Django for backend web development.
- Bootstrap for responsive design and layout.
- Cloudinary for image storage.

## Database Design
- While planning this project, I drew up an Entity Relationship Diagram to help me visualise the database models and their relationships.

## Testing
Manual testing was conducted for all key features, including recipe submission,  edit shared recipes, and commenting functionality. Testing ensures that all components work smoothly on various devices and browsers.
For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](documentation]TESTING.md) file.
## Issues and Bugs
- Resolved issues with recipe form submission.
- Adjusted layout for consistent display of recipe cards.
- Ongoing improvements for mobile responsiveness.

## Deployment
- The application was deployed using Heroku, and the database was configured with PostgreSQL.
- Cloudinary was integrated to manage image uploads for recipes.

The following steps for creating and configuring a new Python workspace and API credentials have been informed by and adapted from the Python walkthrough project 'Recipe Haven' by [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/). Please ensure each step is applicable to your project requirements and adjust the provided data accordingly.

### Creating a new repository 
<details open>
<summary>Steps to create a new repository.</summary>  
The [Code Institute's Python Essential Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) was used to create a terminal for my Python file to generate it's output. 

To utilise this template, adhere to these steps:
1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or register for a new account.
2. Go to the Python template repository provided above.
3. Select '**Use this template**' -> '**Create a new repository**'.
4. Pick a new repository name and choose '**Create repository from template**'.
5. Within your new repository area, click the green '**Gitpod**' button to create a new workspace.

#### Deploying to Heroku 
The Recipe Haven project was deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and connected to an external PostgreSQL database hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com). Below is a step-by-step guide to the deployment process:

##### Steps for Deployment:

1. **Set Up the Project Locally**:
   - Ensure that your project is properly set up and working locally before deploying. Install all necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Set Up Heroku**:
   - Log in to your [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) account.
   - Create a new Heroku app by clicking **New** > **Create New App**.
   - Choose a unique app name and select the region closest to your location.

3. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - In Heroku, go to the **Resources** tab of your app.
   - Under **Add-ons**, search for and add **Heroku Postgres** as your database.
   - Alternatively, use [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for your PostgreSQL database by creating an instance on ElephantSQL and copying the database URL.
   - In your Heroku app, navigate to **Settings** > **Reveal Config Vars** and set the following environment variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL database URL (from either Heroku Postgres or ElephantSQL).
     - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for your Django project.
     - `DEBUG`: Set to `False` for production.

4. **Set Up Cloudinary for Static and Media Files**:
   - Sign up for a [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account to store static files and images.
   - In Herokuâ€™s **Config Vars**, add the following variable:
     - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Your Cloudinary API environment variable.
   - Update your Django settings to handle static and media files via Cloudinary.

5. **Prepare Your Application for Deployment**:
   - Make sure you have a `Procfile` in the root of your project, specifying how Heroku should run your app:
     ```
     web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi
     ```
   - Make migrations for your database:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Collect static files to be served by Cloudinary:
     ```bash
     python manage.py collectstatic
     ```

6. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   - Connect your Heroku app to your GitHub repository under the **Deploy** tab in Heroku.
   - Enable automatic deploys from the `main` branch, or manually deploy by clicking the **Deploy Branch** button.

7. **Run the App**:
   - Once deployed, your app should be live at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`.
   - Use the **Heroku logs** command to troubleshoot any issues:
     ```bash
     heroku logs --tail
     ```
